Additionally, the project aims to develop predictive models to forecast future food prices based on historical data. Through these analyses, the project seeks to provide insights into regional pricing patterns and potential future trends in food costs.\n\nSkills: Data scraping/mining, Data Cleaning, Data Analysis, correlation matrices, hypothesis testing, Machine learning\n\nTechnologies: python, Pandas, Numpy, Scipy, Seaborn, Plotly, Pmdarima, Dash\n\nResults: The analysis revealed significant regional price differences, historical trends, and future projections of food prices, providing insights into market dynamics.\n\n2. \n\nGoal: \n\nDescription: \n\nSkills: \n\nTechnologies: \n\nResults: \n\n3. \n\nGoal: \n\nDescription: \n\nSkills: \n\nTechnologies: \n\nResults: \n\n4. \n\nGoal: \n\nDescription: \n\nSkills: \n\nTechnologies: \n\nResults: \n\n5. \n\nGoal: \n\nDescription: \n\nSkills: \n\nTechnologies: \n\nResults: \n\n6. \n\nGoal: \n\nDescription: \n\nSkills: \n\nTechnologies: \n\nResults: \n\n7. \n\nGoal: \n\nDescription: \n\nSkills: \n\nTechnologies: \n\nResults: \n\n8. \n\nGoal: \n\nDescription: \n\nSkills: \n\nTechnologies: \n\nResults: \n\n9. \n\nGoal: \n\nDescription: \n\nSkills: \n\nTechnologies: \n\nResults: ","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n1.
