Compare average prices across different regions for the same food item and year.\n2. Examine how prices of a specific food item have changed over time within a region.\n3. Identify regional price variations for different food items.\n4. Predict future food prices based on historical data.\n\n#### Inspect the data\n\nFor comparing average prices across regions for the same food item and year, the closing price is generally the best price to use. Here’s why:\n\n1. Consistency: The closing price is considered the most representative of the market's consensus for that period. It accounts for the entire trading session and reflects both supply and demand dynamics over time.\n2. Standard Usage: The closing price is the most widely used price in financial markets, meaning data and analysis are typically focused around this price.\n3. Simplicity: It eliminates the noise created by intra-day fluctuations, focusing on the price at the end of the trading session, which is more relevant for long-term comparisons.\n\nThe graph shows the mean (average) price or median price of different food items over time for different regions in the Philippines.\n#### Key Observation\n1. Trend - Generally, the price of all food items has been increasing over the years across most regions. There are some fluctuations and periods of stability for some items, but the overall trend is upward.\n2. Regional Differences - There is significant variation in price of different food items across regions. Some regions consistently have higher prices than others. Price fluctuations also varies between regions. Some regions experience more volatile prices than others.\n\nFactors like weather patterns, government policies, agriculture changes, food transportation and global market trends can influence these prices.\n\nTo know which regions has the highest and lowest price every year for every food item, max, min will be calculated. Then range is next to know how wide the difference between the highest and lowest price.\n\nKey Observations:\n1. Overall Trend - Both the minimum and maximum prices show a general upward trend over the years, indicating an overall increase in the price of every food items. Some even recorded highest price increase on 2020, likely due to the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on supply chains.\n2. Price Range - The gap between the minimum and maximum prices for most items widens significantly in 2020 and 2021. This suggests that there were greater variations in prices across regions during these years.\n\nPosssible causes:\n1. COVID-19 Pandemic - The pandemic disrupted supply chains and increased demand for certain food items, which could have led to price volatility.\n2. Regional Differences - Differences in the impact of the pandemic on regional economies and agricultural production could have contributed to price variations.\n\nTo truly know if the regions really have price difference over the years, hypothesis testing must be done. Please refer to <ins>..\\Data\\Processed\\hypothesis_testing.ipynb</ins> to know why Kruskall-Wallis was used here.\n\nThis means all the items for all the regions over the year have different prices. But which regions have different prices?\n\nThis heatmap visualizes the results of a Dunn's post-hoc test for significant differences in prices of different food items between regions across the years.<br>\n<space><br>\nThe color scale indicates the following:\n*   Red (Close to 0): Indicates a statistically significant difference in bean prices between two regions.\n*   Light Green to Yellow (Around 0.2 to 0.8): Suggests a possible difference, but not statistically significant based on the chosen significance level (typically 0.05)\n*   Dark Green (Close to 0): Indicates no statistically significant difference in bean prices between the two regions.\n\n#### Key Observations\n1. Significant Differences Exist: The presence of so many red cells indicates that there are statistically significant differences in food prices in almost all regions at any given years.\n2. No Significant Differences: patches of green indicate pairs of regions where the Dunn's test did not find a statistically significant difference in food prices, but there are only few of them.\n3. Market Average Comparison: The \"Market Average\" row/column allows you to see how each region's prices compare to the overall average. Dark red cells in this row/column would indicate regions with prices significantly different from the market average.\n\nFood price Prediction 3 years into the future\n\n#### Key Observations\n1. Historical Price Volatility: The blue line representing historical prices shows significant fluctuations, especially noticeable spikes around 2008 and smaller ones in other years. This indicates that most food prices have been subject to considerable volatility over the past two decades.\n2. Recent Price Increase: There's a clear upward trend in food prices in the period leading up to the forecast (roughly from 2020 to 2024). This suggests recent factors have been pushing prices higher.\n3. Relatively Stable Forecast: The red dashed line, representing the forecast for the next 36 months, shows a relatively stable and slightly upward trend. The model predicts a continued but moderated increase compared to the recent past.\n\n#### Key Observations\n1. Historical Volatility:\n    * Weather Patterns:adverse weather events in key agricultural regions can significantly impact supply and cause price volatility.\n    * Changes in Demand: Fluctuations in global demand, driven by population growth or economic factors, can also contribute to price swings.\n2. Recent Price Increase:\n    * Inflation: General inflation in the economy could be pushing up agricultural commodity prices.\n    * Supply Chain Issues: Disruptions to global supply chains (e.g., due to pandemics, conflicts, or trade policies) can lead to shortages and price increases.\n    * Increased Input Costs: Rising costs of fertilizers, fuel, and labor can increase the cost of food production, which could be passed on to consumers.\n3. Relatively Stable Forecast:\n    * Model Assumption: ARIMA models assume that, to some extent, future trends will resemble past patterns. The stable forecast suggests the model has not picked up any strong upward or downward pressures for the next 36 months beyond what is already captured in the recent trend.\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Aims:\n1.
