**Goal**: To Analyze food price variations across different regions and time periods
\
\
**Description**: The main objectives include comparing average prices of the same food item across regions within a given year, examining historical price trends of specific food items within a region, and identifying regional price variations for different food items. Additionally, the project aims to develop predictive models to forecast future food prices based on historical data. Through these analyses, the project seeks to provide insights into regional pricing patterns and potential future trends in food costs.

Goal:  to determine whether movie lengths are actually getting shorter and explain some of the contributing factors.
\
\
Description: Given the large number of movies and series available on the platform, It’s a perfect opportunity for me to flex my exploratory data analysis skills and dive into the entertainment industry. I’ve also been brushing up on my Python skills and have taken an initial look at a CSV file containing Netflix data. I believe that the average duration of movies has been declining. Using my initial research, I’ll delve into the Netflix data to determine whether movie lengths are actually getting shorter and explain some of the contributing factors, if any.
