**Viz** : [Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/views/PhilippineFoodPriceAnalysisandDashboard/foodpricedashboard?:language=en-US&:sid=&:redirect=auth&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link), [PowerBI](https://github.com/envicdus/Data_Analysis/tree/main/Philippine_food_price_Analysis_and_Visualization/Reports/PowerBI)
\
\
**Goal**: To Analyze food price variations across different regions and time periods
\
\
**Description**: The main objectives include comparing average prices of the same food item across regions within a given year, examining historical price trends of specific food items within a region, and identifying regional price variations for different food items. Additionally, the project aims to develop predictive models to forecast future food prices based on historical data. Through these analyses, the project seeks to provide insights into regional pricing patterns and potential future trends in food costs.
\
\
**Skills**: Data scraping/mining, Data Cleaning, Data Analysis, correlation matrices, hypothesis testing, Machine learning, Automation
\
\
**Technologies**: python, Pandas, Numpy, Scipy, Seaborn, Plotly, Pmdarima, Airflow
\
\
**Results**: The analysis revealed significant regional price differences, historical trends, and future projections of food prices, providing insights into market dynamics.

## Investigating Netflx Movies

**Full Analysis**: [Click Here](_site\Investigating Netflix Movies\notebook.html)<br>

\
\
**Goal**:  to determine whether movie lengths are actually getting shorter and explain some of the contributing factors.
\
\
**Description**: Given the large number of movies and series available on the platform, It’s a perfect opportunity for me to flex my exploratory data analysis skills and dive into the entertainment industry. I’ve also been brushing up on my Python skills and have taken an initial look at a CSV file containing Netflix data. I believe that the average duration of movies has been declining. Using my initial research, I’ll delve into the Netflix data to determine whether movie lengths are actually getting shorter and explain some of the contributing factors, if any.
\
\
**Skills**: Data Cleaning, Data Analysis, Data Visualization, EDA
\
\
**Technologies**: python, Pandas, Matplotlib
\
\
**Results**: The result of the analysis is uncertain.

## International Debt Statistics Analysis

**Project link**: [Click Here](https://github.com/envicdus/Data_Analysis/tree/main/Analyze%20International%20Debt%20Statistics)<br>
**Full Analysis**: [Click Here](_site\Analyze International Debt Statistics\notebook.html)<br>
\
\
**Goal**: Analyzing International Debt Data: Understanding the Total Debt, Maximum Debt by Country, and Average Debt Across Indicators.
\
\
**Description**: This notebook explores the World Bank's international debt dataset to uncover key trends and patterns, including total debt, country-specific debt, and average debt by indicator.
\
\
**Skills**: Data Wrangling, Data Analysis, EDA, Data Interpretation
\
\
**Technologies**: Python, Pandas, sqlite3, sql, jupysql
\
\
**Results**: This analysis reveals that debt structures vary significantly by country, reflecting distinct economic strategies. Developed economies, such as Brazil, Mexico, and China, rely more on private creditors, bonds, and market-based financing, whereas least developed countries depend on bilateral and official loans from international institutions. Notably, interest payments pose a significant risk to countries like Mexico and China, requiring careful budget management to maintain financial stability. Furthermore, countries that rely on private creditors or bond markets face higher risks due to market volatility, interest rate hikes, and investor sentiment. Overall, these findings highlight the importance of understanding country-specific debt structures and the associated risks to inform economic policy and decision-making.


## Carbon Footprint Analysis<br>
**Project link**: [Click Here](https://github.com/envicdus/Data_Analysis/tree/main/Analyzing%20Carbon%20Footprints)<br>
**Full Analysis**: [Click Here](_site\Analyzing Carbon Footprints\notebook.html)<br>
\
\
**Goal**: Analyze carbon dioxide emissions of various countries and understand why they have those numbers in the data.
\
\
**Description**: Product emissions make up more than 75% of global emissions. But which industries are the worst offenders? This analysis provides insight on this topic.
\
\
**Skills**: Exploratory Data Analysis, SQL query, Statistics, Data Visualization
\
\
**Technologies**: Python, Pandas, Sqlite3, sql


## Motorcycle Part Sale Analysis<br>
**Project link**: [Click Here](https://github.com/envicdus/Data_Analysis/tree/main/Analyzing%20Motorcycle%20parts%20sale)<br>
**Full Analysis**: [Click Here](_site\Analyzing Motorcycle parts sale\notebook.html)<br>
\
\
**Goal**: to provide a clean dataset from raw data by applying sql querying skill and output a dataset with a format.
\
\
**Description**: You're working for a company that sells motorcycle parts, and they've asked for some help in analyzing their sales data!

They operate three warehouses in the area, selling both retail and wholesale. They offer a variety of parts and accept credit cards, cash, and bank transfer as payment methods. However, each payment type incurs a different fee.

The board of directors wants to gain a better understanding of wholesale revenue by product line, and how this varies month-to-month and across warehouses. You have been tasked with calculating net revenue for each product line and grouping results by month and warehouse. The results should be filtered so that only "Wholesale" orders are included.
\
\
**Skills**: SQL query
\
\
**Technologies**: sqlite3, postgreSQL


## Analyzing Student's Mental Health<br>
**Project link**: [Click Here](https://github.com/envicdus/Data_Analysis/tree/main/Analyzing%20Student's%20mental%20health)<br>
**Full Analysis**: [Click Here](_site\Analyzing Student's mental health\notebook.html)<br>
\
\
**Goal**: Explore the data using PostgreSQL to find out if you would come to a similar conclusion for international students and see if the length of stay is a contributing factor in mental health decline.
\
\
**Description**: Does going to university in a different country affect your mental health? A Japanese international university surveyed its students in 2018 and published a study the following year that was approved by several ethical and regulatory boards.

The study found that international students have a higher risk of mental health difficulties than the general population, and that social connectedness (belonging to a social group) and acculturative stress (stress associated with joining a new culture) are predictive of depression.
\
\
**Skills**: SQL query
\
\
**Technologies**: sqlite3, postgreSQL
